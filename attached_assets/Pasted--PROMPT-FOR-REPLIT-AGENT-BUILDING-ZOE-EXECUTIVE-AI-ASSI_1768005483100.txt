## **PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT: BUILDING ZOE, EXECUTIVE AI ASSISTANT**

**Subject:** Implementation Requirements for "Zoe" - Executive AI Assistant Integration

**Agent,** 

You are building the web application for **White Caves Real Estate LLC, Dubai**. I need you to implement **Zoe**, the Executive AI Assistant to the Managing Director, as a core feature of the dashboard/backend.

### **1. ZOE'S CORE ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Interface:** Create a dedicated "Zoe Console" panel in the MD's dashboard with:
  - Text input (with voice-to-text option)
  - Response display area
  - Conversation history sidebar
  - Quick-action buttons (e.g., "Daily Briefing", "Prepare Meeting", "Find Client")
- **Backend:** Implement using a suitable AI framework (consider LangChain for orchestration) with secure API connections
- **Authentication:** Zoe should ONLY be accessible to the MD and authorized executives via role-based permissions

### **2. COMPANY KNOWLEDGE BASE IMPLEMENTATION:**

Inject these structured datasets into Zoe's contextual memory:

**A. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE (Hierarchical JSON format):**
```json
{
  "company": "White Caves Real Estate LLC",
  "location": "Dubai, UAE",
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Executive Office",
      "members": ["Managing Director", "Assistant Manager (Zara)"],
      "direct_reports_to": "Managing Director"

}
```

**B. SERVICES LIST (Categorized array):**

### **3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

Implement these specific capabilities:

1. **Query Understanding:** Zoe should recognize queries about:
   - "Who handles commercial leasing?"
   - "What's our process for villa sales?"
   - "Which department manages tenant complaints?"
   - "Show me our premium services"

2. **Contextual Responses:** When asked about a service, Zoe should:
   - List the steps
   - Identify responsible department/contact
   - Provide estimated timelines (if available in data)
   - Link to relevant documents/forms in the system

3. **Proactive Features:**
   - Daily 9 AM briefing on company metrics
   - Alert when projects are behind schedule
   - Reminders for executive approvals needed

### **4. INTEGRATION POINTS:**

- **Calendar Integration:** Connect to MD's Google Calendar/Outlook
- **Document Access:** Secure access to company drive (read-only for most docs)
- **CRM Connection:** Pull client data when requested (with privacy filters)
- **Task Management:** Create tasks in Asana/Trello based on conversations

### **5. SECURITY PROTOCOLS:**

- **No data persistence** of sensitive conversations beyond session
- **Role-based access control** to internal data
- **Audit logging** of all queries and responses
- **Data encryption** for all transmissions

### **6. TESTING SCENARIOS:**

Please test that Zoe can accurately answer:
- "What are the steps in our property management service?"
- "Who should I contact about a commercial leasing inquiry?"
- "List all residential services we offer"
- "Walk me through the investment consultation process"

### **7. UI/UX NOTES:**

- Use company colors: White, Deep Blue, and Gold accents
- Professional, minimalist interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Include a small "Zoe" avatar/logo in the corner

**Deliverables:**
1. Working Zoe module in the MD dashboard
2. Knowledge base configuration interface (for future updates by Zara)
3. API documentation for future integrations
4. Security audit report

**Timeline:** Please provide implementation timeline with milestones.

Let me know if you need additional company data or clarification on any service flows.

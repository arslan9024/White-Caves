I will design a clean, structured plan to reorganize your CRM's navigation by separating general application features from AI-specific dashboard tools. This follows modern SaaS application patterns where global controls live in a persistent top bar, while workspace content remains context-specific.

## 📐 **Information Architecture & Layout Reorganization Plan**

### **1. New Application Layout Structure**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MAIN NAVIGATION BAR (Persistent - App Level)                       │
│  [Logo]  |  Search Component  |  Notifications  |  Theme Toggle  |  │
│  Company Owner Dropdown (Profile, Settings, Logout)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│  AI ASSISTANT CONTEXT BAR (Dynamic - Changes per AI)                │
│  [Aurora - CTO]  [Tab1]  [Tab2]  [Tab3]  [Tab4]                    │
│                                                                     │
│  DASHBOARD CONTENT AREA (AI-Specific Tools & Data)                  │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                                                             │   │
│  │  Charts, Metrics, AI Tools specific to active assistant     │   │
│  │                                                             │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **2. Main Navigation Bar Specifications**

**Position & Behavior:** Fixed to top of window, always visible, 64px height.

**Left Section (Brand & Primary Navigation):**
- Company Logo/Name (click returns to home dashboard)
- **Search Component:** Global search across properties, contacts, deals, documents
- **AI Assistant Selector:** Dropdown to switch between Aurora (CTO), Sales AI, Support AI, etc.

**Right Section (User & App Controls):**
- **Theme Toggle:** Light/Dark/System preference switch (icon only)
- **Notifications Bell:** Badge for unread count, dropdown panel for alerts
- **Company Owner Profile:**
  - Avatar/Initials (dropdown trigger)
  - Dropdown contains: Profile, Account Settings, Billing, Team Management, Logout

**Design Principles:**
- Use subtle backgrounds (e.g., `--background-paper` elevation 1)
- Icons with text labels on hover for learnability
- Consistent spacing (16px between items)
- Mobile-responsive collapse into hamburger menu

### **3. AI Assistant Dashboard Area Structure**

**AI Context Header:**
- Display active AI assistant's name and role (e.g., "Aurora - Chief Technology Officer")
- Assistant-specific quick actions (e.g., "Generate Report", "Analyze Performance")
- Assistant status/availability indicator

**Sub-Navigation/Tabs System:**
- **Tab Design:** Contained or underlined tabs, clearly separated from main nav
- **Tab Content:** Dynamically changes based on selected AI assistant
- **Examples by Assistant:**

| AI Assistant | Example Tabs | Purpose |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Aurora (CTO)** | System Health, Code Review, DevOps, Security, Documentation | Technical oversight |
| **Sales AI** | Lead Pipeline, Performance Forecast, Communication Templates, Deal Analysis | Sales optimization |
| **Support AI** | Ticket Dashboard, Response Assistant, Knowledge Base, Customer Sentiment | Customer service |
| **Marketing AI** | Campaign Analytics, Content Calendar, Lead Scoring, ROI Calculator | Marketing operations |

### **4. Dashboard Content Zone Principles**

**For Aurora's Dashboard (Example):**
- **System Health Tab:** Server status, API latency charts, error rate monitoring
- **Code Review Tab:** Pull request queue, code quality metrics, deployment status
- **DevOps Tab:** Resource utilization, CI/CD pipeline visualization, backup status
- **Security Tab:** Vulnerability alerts, access logs, compliance checklist

**Content Design Rules:**
- No repeat of main nav components (search, profile, theme toggle, notifications)
- Full-width utilization of remaining space
- Consistent card-based layout for metrics
- AI-specific action buttons prominently placed
- Real-time data with manual refresh options

### **5. Implementation Phases**

**Phase 1: Information Architecture (Week 1-2)**
- Map all existing dashboard features to new structure
- Define tab structures for each AI assistant
- Create wireframes for main nav and 2 key AI dashboards

**Phase 2: UI Component Library (Week 2-3)**
- Build reusable main nav component
- Create tab system with dynamic content loading
- Design metric cards and AI-specific widgets
- Ensure responsive breakpoints

**Phase 3: AI Context Integration (Week 3-4)**
- Implement assistant-switching logic
- Connect each AI's tabs to relevant backend data
- Add persistent state (remember last used tab per AI)
- Implement permission-based tab visibility

**Phase 4: User Testing & Refinement (Week 5)**
- Conduct usability tests with real estate team
- Gather feedback on tab labeling and feature discoverability
- Optimize mobile experience
- Document navigation patterns for new users

### **6. Success Metrics**
- **Reduced Click Depth:** Access to general features from anywhere in app
- **Context Preservation:** Users don't lose AI workspace when checking notifications
- **Learnability:** New users understand separation between app and AI tools
- **Performance:** Main nav loads independently of dashboard content

This structure creates a scalable foundation where adding new AI assistants simply requires defining their tab set and connecting to relevant data sources, without redesigning the core navigation.

**To move forward with this plan:** Start by inventorying all features currently in your dashboard and categorizing them as either "General App" (to main nav) or "AI-Specific" (to dashboard tabs). This will clarify the scope before any UI work begins.

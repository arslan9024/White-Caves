**Project Requirements for Web Application Development**

**Objective:**  
Enhance and standardize the dashboard system for a multi-role web application with consistent design, reusable components, and centralized state management.

**Tasks:**

1. **Fix Homepage Issue**  
   - Diagnose and resolve the blank/white page problem on the homepage.  
   - Ensure the homepage loads correctly with all intended elements visible.

2. **Design Consistency Across Dashboards**  
   - Copy the existing design of the **main navigation bar** and **company owner dashboard**.  
   - Apply the same visual design and layout to dashboards for all other user roles (e.g., manager, employee, admin).  
   - Use **reusable React components** to maintain consistency.  
   - Implement **Redux** for managing shared state (e.g., user data, UI state) across all dashboards.

3. **Multi-Role Dashboard Preview**  
   - Include a **dropdown menu** in the company owner dashboard that lists all user roles.  
   - Allow switching between different dashboards via the dropdown to review design consistency.

4. **Universal Profile Button**  
   - Ensure every **profile button** across the application triggers the same event.  
   - This event should display a **profile component** inside the current dashboard for viewing and completing user profiles.

5. **Universal Dashboard Components**  
   - Add **reusable components** (e.g., time display, weather widget) to all dashboards.  
   - Verify that these components appear and function consistently across every user role's dashboard.

**Deliverables:**  
- A fully functional homepage without blank page issues.  
- Consistently designed dashboards for all user roles using reusable React components.  
- Redux integrated for state management.  
- A role-switching dropdown in the company owner dashboard.  
- A universal profile button that opens a profile component within the dashboard.  
- Shared components (time, weather, etc.) on every dashboard.

**Constraints:**  
- Maintain existing functionality unless otherwise specified.  
- Prioritize code reusability and consistency in UI/UX.

Transform our real estate website into a comprehensive, role-based platform by developing distinct user portals on dedicated subdomains—**sellers.whitecaves.com**, **buyers.whitecaves.com**, **tenants.whitecaves.com**, and **employees.whitecaves.com**—each with a customized interface, dashboard, and feature set tailored to the specific needs of sellers (property listing tools, valuation reports, offer management), buyers (saved searches, property comparisons, mortgage calculator, booking viewings), tenants (rental applications, lease documents, maintenance requests), and employees/agents (CRM, lead management, pipeline tracking, commission calculator, document generation for DLD). Ensure all generic, non-sensitive features are seamlessly available across all roles, while strictly reserving confidential business intelligence—such as overall company financials, internal performance analytics, owner profit margins, and strategic partnership details—exclusively for the main owner account dashboard on the primary domain, protected by robust authentication and multi-factor verification. Implement a centralized user management system with granular permissions, single sign-on (SSO) across subdomains, and dynamic UI components that adapt content, navigation, and actions based on the logged-in user's role, ensuring a cohesive yet personalized experience where every page, from property detail views to dashboards, intelligently presents relevant tools, data, and calls-to-action without exposing cross-role sensitive information, all built on a secure, scalable architecture that maintains brand consistency while empowering each user group with purpose-driven functionality.

Revamp our Dubai real estate website into an intelligent, dynamic web application by implementing an engaging **role-based onboarding gateway** on the homepage where users are either prompted with a clear question ("How can we assist you today?") or presented with visually distinct, branded tiles (e.g., "I want to Sell/List a Property," "I'm Looking to Buy," "I need to Rent or Lease," "I'm an Employee/Agent") that, upon selection, seamlessly redirect them to the corresponding personalized subdomain portal (sellers.whitecaves.com, buyers.whitecaves.com, tenants.whitecaves.com, employees.whitecaves.com) and simultaneously trigger the creation of a role-tailored user profile and dashboard. Ensure each portal dynamically loads only the relevant data, tools, and workflows for that specific user type: sellers view their listing performance, valuation history, and inquiry analytics; buyers access saved searches, property alerts, viewing schedules, and mortgage tools; tenants see active leases, payment portals, and maintenance tickets; and employees get a professional CRM with lead pipelines, appointment calendars, DLD transaction tracking, and commission dashboards. Build the entire application using a modern reactive framework (like React or Vue) for real-time updates, implement a secure GraphQL or REST API to serve role-specific data efficiently, use state management to maintain user context across subdomains via secure tokens, and ensure all interfaces are fully responsive, fast-loading, and offer interactive features such as live notifications, drag-and-drop dashboards, and in-browser document signing—all while maintaining a unified design system and robust privacy controls that keep each user’s experience focused, relevant, and powerfully customized to their needs in the Dubai real estate market.

Update the CSS for our Dubai real estate web application to implement a sophisticated, dual-theme design system that strictly adheres to our core brand color scheme of **Red (`#D32F2F` for primary actions, `#B71C1C` for hover states) and White (`#FFFFFF` for backgrounds, `#F5F5F5` for secondary surfaces)**, while introducing a fully functional, user-selectable **Light and Dark Theme** that maintains perfect color contrast and brand identity. For the Light Theme, use a near-white (`#FAFAFA`) base with clean white cards (`#FFFFFF`), dark gray text (`#212121` for primary, `#424242` for secondary), and our signature red for accents, buttons, and highlights. For the Dark Theme, invert the palette using a deep charcoal (`#121212`) base, slightly lighter charcoal cards (`#1E1E1E`), and off-white text (`#E0E0E0` for primary, `#9E9E9E` for secondary), while keeping the same vibrant red (`#FF5252` for accessibility in dark mode) for all interactive elements, ensuring all text and UI components meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA contrast standards in both themes (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components).

Apply this design system consistently across all role-based subdomains (sellers, buyers, tenants, employees), using a modular CSS architecture (preferably CSS-in-JS or CSS Custom Properties for dynamic theming). Implement a persistent theme toggle switch in the global navigation that allows users to choose their preference, which is saved via `localStorage`. Redesign all UI components—including the role-selection gateway tiles, dashboard cards, data tables, forms, and interactive maps—to use this dual-token system, ensuring visual hierarchy is maintained through intelligent use of spacing, shadows (subtle in light theme, glowing/colored in dark theme), and font weights. Specifically, ensure all data visualizations, agent profiles, and property cards are legible in both themes, and that the Google Maps embed is styled with a complementary palette (e.g., a "silver" map style for light theme, a "dark" mode for dark theme). The final implementation must be performant, with no flicker on initial load, and must enhance the dynamic, application-like feel of the platform without compromising the bold, professional identity of the red and white brand.

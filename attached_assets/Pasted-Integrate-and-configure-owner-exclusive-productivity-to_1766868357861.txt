Integrate and configure owner-exclusive productivity tools into our business dashboard by embedding secure, authenticated access to key Google Workspace applications—specifically Google Drive (with a dedicated "Owner" folder structure for documents), Google Tasks (displaying a private task list widget), Google Calendar (showing only the owner's schedule), and Google Keep (for private notes)—alongside other free business utilities such as Trello (for project boards), Slack (direct message widget), and a password manager interface (like Bitwarden), ensuring all integrations are placed within a password-protected or role-restricted admin panel that requires owner login credentials, display these tools in a clean, grid-based widget layout with customizable modules, implement token-based OAuth for secure Google API connections that only request necessary permissions, and include clear setup instructions for each service while maintaining a seamless, professional UI that matches our site's branding without compromising site performance or security.

Update and configure the embedded Google Maps across our entire website—specifically on contact pages, property location displays, and area guides—to focus comprehensively on Dubai with a fully zoomed-out default view showing the entire emirate, then implement custom interactive markers for all our listed properties (using distinct icons for residential, commercial, and luxury segments) that display rich info windows with photos, pricing, and "View Details" links, alongside layered markers for our office locations, key landmarks (shopping malls, metro stations, schools), and neighborhood boundaries with custom shaded overlays, while enabling advanced features like Street View integration, direction finders from user-input or geolocated starting points, and a searchable map filter that allows users to toggle between property types, price ranges, and amenities; ensure the map's style is customized with a subdued color palette (muted land colors, highlighted roads) to match our website theme, that it loads asynchronously for performance, is fully responsive on all devices, and includes clear attribution and a privacy-compliant consent mechanism for EU visitors under GDPR, all while maintaining a clean, intuitive UI that enhances user experience without overwhelming the page layout.

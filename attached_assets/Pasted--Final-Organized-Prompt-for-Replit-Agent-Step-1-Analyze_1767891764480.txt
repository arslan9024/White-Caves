**Final Organized Prompt for Replit Agent:**

**Step 1: Analyze Current State**
- Access Aurora documentation to review existing project architecture
- Examine AI assistant registry (12 assistants total)
- Review current component library and Redux state structure
- Identify all existing design patterns and reusable components

**Step 2: Process Upgrade Instructions**
- Read detailed upgrade requirements from the provided text file
- Map each requirement to specific AI assistants and features
- Prioritize upgrades based on current project state

**Step 3: Implement Unified Architecture**
1. **Create AI Command Center Sidebar**
   - Transform array of 12 assistants into persistent right sidebar
   - Each assistant tile displays: avatar, name, notification badge, status, quick action
   - Implement real-time notification system linking user actions to relevant assistants

2. **Establish Dashboard Layout Pattern**
   - All assistants follow consistent layout:
     * Left (25%): Assistant-specific feature navigation
     * Right (75%): Main content area with data views
   - Implement responsive design for all screen sizes

**Step 4: Assistant-Specific Upgrades (Execute in Order)**
1. **Theodora**: Payment message generator (QR code, cheque, bank transfer)
2. **Linda**: Agent task assignment dropdown for message distribution
3. **Clara**: Lead organization into rent/sale categories with separate views
4. **Mary**: Single property detail viewer with gallery and specifications
5. **Nina**: WhatsApp bot manager with QR linking and delete functionality
6. **Olivia**: Multi-platform property integration (Bayut, Property Finder, Dubizzle)
7. **Nancy**: Job posting manager with social media sharing
8. **Sophia, Daisy, Zoe, Laila, Aurora**: Complete dashboard implementations

**Step 5: Component System Enhancement**
- Extract and create reusable components: BigTileCard, DataGridView, ActivityTimeline
- Ensure design consistency across all modules
- Implement proper loading/error states

**Step 6: State Management Optimization**
- Consolidate duplicate Redux slices into single source
- Implement proper action-reducer patterns
- Add memoization and caching strategies
- Set up real-time update mechanisms

**Step 7: Performance Improvements**
- Memoize selector functions
- Implement lazy loading for dashboards
- Add error boundaries to all modules
- Optimize bundle size through code splitting

**Step 8: Documentation Update**
- Refresh Aurora with updated assistant inventory and features
- Add current project development statistics
- Update architectural diagrams and component library
- Document new Redux state structure and API endpoints

**Execution Priority:**
1. Critical fixes and architecture foundation
2. Assistant-specific feature implementations
3. Component extraction and design consistency
4. Performance optimization
5. Documentation updates

**Quality Requirements:**
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing project conventions
- Ensure responsive design throughout
- Test all user flows thoroughly
- Document any architectural deviations in Aurora

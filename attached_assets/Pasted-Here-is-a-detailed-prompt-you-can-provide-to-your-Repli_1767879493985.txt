Here is a detailed prompt you can provide to your Replit AI agent to replace the static element with an interactive, animated home visualizer.

**Homepage Component Replacement & Enhancement**

**Primary Objective:**  
Replace the static text or HTML element currently displaying **"Luxury home"** on the homepage with an interactive, animated React component. This new component will allow users to visualize a future home by applying different color schemes.

**1. Core Requirements:**

*   **Element Replacement:** Locate the exact HTML element, component, or section containing the text "Luxury home" on the main homepage. Remove this static content and replace it with the new interactive component.
*   **Interactive Home Model:** Implement an animated 3D or high-quality 2D illustration/vector of a modern luxury home. The model should have clearly defined sections (e.g., walls, roof, doors, trim) that can be individually re-colored.
*   **Color Selection Feature:**
    *   Create a user-friendly color palette selector (e.g., a grid of color swatches or a custom color picker).
    *   Clicking a color swatch should immediately apply that color to the primary exterior walls of the home model in a smooth, animated transition.
    *   **Advanced Option:** Include tabs or a menu to switch between painting different parts of the home (e.g., "Main Walls," "Roof," "Accents," "Door").
*   **Animation:** Integrate subtle, continuous animations to make the home visualization engaging (e.g., gentle floating effect, soft ambient glow, or slow, cinematic rotation). Color change transitions should be smooth (e.g., a fade or fill effect).

**2. Technical Specifications:**

*   **Framework:** Build as a reusable React functional component (e.g., `FutureHomeVisualizer`).
*   **State Management:** Use React `useState` to manage the currently selected color and active house part. Integrate this state with the project's existing Redux store if a global state for user preferences is required elsewhere.
*   **Styling:** Use CSS modules or styled-components to ensure the component's styling is self-contained and does not conflict with the existing homepage CSS. The design must be consistent with the luxury aesthetic of the DAMAC Hills 2 project.
*   **Performance:** The component should be optimized for fast loading. Consider using a lightweight SVG for the home model or implementing lazy loading for the component.

**3. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX):**

*   The component should be the visual centerpiece of the homepage hero section.
*   Include a clear, appealing title or call-to-action, such as "Visualize Your Future Home."
*   The color selector should be intuitively placed below or beside the home model.
*   Provide visual feedback when a color is selected (e.g., the selected swatch is highlighted with a border).

**4. Integration Instructions:**

*   The component must be fully responsive and look excellent on all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   Ensure it replaces the old element seamlessly, without breaking the existing page layout or other functionalities.
*   Follow the same design patterns (buttons, fonts, spacing) used in the newly standardized dashboards for consistency.

**5. Deliverables:**

1.  A new, reusable React component: `FutureHomeVisualizer`.
2.  Complete removal of the static "Luxury home" element and flawless integration of the new component.
3.  A working, animated home model with a smooth color selection feature.
4.  Responsive design that matches the project's luxury aesthetic.

### 🎨 Suggestions for Enhancing the Component

Once the basic version is built, you can expand the prompt with these ideas for future iterations:

*   **Pre-set Themes:** Add buttons for pre-designed themes like "Modern White," "Earthy Tones," or "Coastal."
*   **Save & Share:** Allow users to save their color combination (to their user profile in your CRM) or generate a shareable image link.
*   **Environment Toggle:** Let users switch the home's background between day, sunset, and night to see how colors look in different lighting.
*   **Material Textures:** Upgrade from flat colors to material previews (e.g., brick, stone, wood siding).

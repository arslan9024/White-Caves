Based on official Dubai regulations, real estate roles can be categorized into two main types: specific career paths for professionals and the formal list of activities that a company must be licensed to perform by the **Dubai Land Department (DLD) and the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA)**.

Here is an overview of the key professional roles you might find within a Dubai real estate company:

| Professional Role | Core Responsibilities | Key Requirements / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real Estate Agent/Broker** | Facilitates property sales, purchases, and leases; acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. | Must be sponsored by a RERA-licensed brokerage, complete DREI training, pass the RERA exam, and obtain a license. They earn commission-based income (typically 2-5%). |
| **Real Estate Developer** | Acquires land, plans, finances, and oversees construction projects for sale or lease. | Must register with RERA and open an escrow account for off-plan sales to protect buyer funds. Can be a **Principal Developer** (develops the main project) or **Sub-Developer** (develops part of a larger project). |
| **Property Manager** | Manages day-to-day operations of buildings or communities, including maintenance, tenant relations, fee collection, and financial reporting. | For managing third-party properties, the company must provide a substantial bank guarantee (e.g., AED 5 million). Often works under a "Jointly Owned Property Management" license. |
| **Real Estate Valuer** | Determines the market value of properties for sales, financing, investment, or tax purposes. | Requires a specific "Real Estate Valuation Services" license from RERA. |

### 📝 Key Considerations Before Applying
*   **Visa and Sponsorship**: You must have a valid UAE residency visa to work. Brokers get this through their sponsoring brokerage. Property management company owners can obtain a visa through their business.
*   **No Freelance Option**: You cannot operate as a freelance real estate agent in Dubai; working under a licensed company is mandatory.
*   **Central System**: All applications are processed through government online portals (DLD's **Trakheesi** for professional licenses and DET for business setup).
*   **Jurisdiction Choice**: For property management, your choice between a **Mainland** license (allows operating across Dubai but requires a local office and higher capital) and a **Free Zone** license (100% foreign ownership, but operations may be geographically restricted) is critical.

### 💡 Next Steps
You can **start the process** for either path by preparing the required documents (passport copies, educational certificates, etc.) and ensuring you meet the basic eligibility criteria, such as being at least 21 years old.
Here is a short, structured prompt you can use to define user roles and permissions for your real estate website, considering both visitors and logged-in users.

**Prompt for Real Estate Website User Roles & Journey:**

"Define the user experience and feature permissions for a Dubai real estate website.

**1. Website Visitor (Unauthenticated User):**
*   Can browse the public website without any login.
*   Can view general property listings, market news, and company information.
*   Can use basic search filters (location, property type, price range).
*   **Cannot** access personalized dashboards, save searches, contact agents directly through private messaging, or list properties.

**2. Logged-in User Roles & Key Permissions:**
Create specific dashboards and tools for these roles:

| User Role | Primary Goals on Website | Key Permissions & Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tenant** | Find & rent properties. | Search/filter rentals, save favorites, contact landlord/agent, manage rental applications, pay rent online, log maintenance requests. |
| **Landlord / Seller** | Lease or sell property. | List properties, manage listings, view inquiries, track performance, communicate with potential tenants/buyers/agents, manage documents. |
| **Buyer** | Find & purchase properties. | Search/filter properties for sale, save favorites, contact seller/agent, schedule viewings, use mortgage calculators. |
| **Leasing Agent / Sales Agent / Broker** | Represent clients, close deals. | Manage client portfolios, list properties on behalf of owners, access advanced CRM tools, communicate with registered users, track leads. |
| **Property Manager / Property Management Company** | Oversee properties & tenants. | Dashboard for multiple properties, manage tenant accounts, track rent collections, coordinate maintenance, generate financial reports. |

| **Freelancer** | (Note: In Dubai, real estate professionals must operate under a licensed company's sponsorship. This role could be for independent contractors affiliated with a company). | Similar permissions to an Agent/Broker but linked to a sponsoring company's account, with potentially limited administrative rights. |

Ensure the login system and user interface clearly differentiate these roles and guide each user to their relevant dashboard and tools upon signing in."


I've structured your requirements into a clear, technical specification suitable for a developer or AI agent. This covers user roles, permissions, dummy data, design fixes, and content integration.

### **Technical Specification: Real Estate Web Application**

**Project Goal:** Build a comprehensive real estate platform for the Dubai market with multiple user roles, an engaging UI, and robust admin controls.

---

### **1. User Roles & Permission Hierarchy**
Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system. The **Company Owner** is the super-admin.

    M[Website Visitor] --> G & H & K

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
```
*(Note: A Freelancer must be sponsored by a licensed company agent in Dubai.)*

**Permission Summary:**
*   **Company Owner:** Full system access (view, edit, delete all data, manage all user accounts, and financials).
*   **Admins (Real Estate/Property Mgmt Co.):** Full access to their company's data and subordinate users.

---

### **2. Content & Dummy Data Strategy**
*   **Source Content:** Extract all text, logos, contact info, and brand details from the provided company file for the "About Us," "Contact," and "Services" pages.
*   **Generate Dummy Data:** Populate the database with realistic, non-real listings for development.
    *   **Properties:** 50+ listings across Dubai (Downtown, Marina, Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills). Mix apartments, villas, offices. Use varied prices (e.g., 500,000 AED studio to 12,000,000 AED villa).
    *   **Users:** Create 2-3 dummy profiles for *each* user role with Arabic/Indian/Western names.
    *   **Activity:** Generate dummy inquiries, viewings, and contracts between dummy users.

---

### **3. UI/UX Design Fixes for Property Listings**
*   **Image Gallery:** Replace basic image displays with an interactive **slider/carousel**. Implement thumbnail navigation and fullscreen view mode.
*   **Property Card:** Design a clean, consistent card for search results.
    *   **Badges:** Use clear tags for status (e.g., `For Sale`, `Rented`, `Off-Plan`).
    *   **Priority Info:** Display **Price, Location, Beds, Baths, Area (sq.ft)** prominently.
*   **Detailed View Page:**
    *   **Sticky "Contact Agent"** button visible while scrolling.
    *   **Tabbed Sections** to organize: Description, Amenities, Floor Plans, Location Map, Virtual Tour.
*   **Search & Filters:**
    *   **Main Filters:** Make `Location` (dropdown with Dubai areas), `Property Type`, `Price Range` (slider with AED), and `Bedrooms` highly visible.
    *   **Advanced Filters:** Use an expandable section for `Area (sq.ft)`, `Keywords`, `Listing Date`.

### **4. Company Owner Admin Dashboard**
Build a central dashboard (`/admin`) exclusively for the **Company Owner** role.

**Dashboard Widgets:**
1.  **System Overview:** Total Users, Total Listings, Active Contracts, Monthly Revenue.
2.  **User Management:** A table with all users. Options to filter by role, edit, or deactivate.
3.  **Content Audit:** A log of all new listings, inquiries, and contracts.
4.  **Global Search:** A search bar that returns results from *any* table (users, properties, contracts).

### **Implementation Priority**
1.  **Week 1:** Set up database with RBAC and create dummy data scripts.
2.  **Week 2:** Implement core property listing pages with new UI design (cards, detailed view, search).
3.  **Week 3:** Build basic dashboards for `Company Owner`, `Agent`, and `Tenant/Buyer`.
4.  **Week 4:** Integrate real company content and finalize permissions.

Would you like me to elaborate on the database schema for the user roles or provide specific code snippets for the property slider component?

Perfect. Using **MongoDB** provides an excellent foundation for this feature. Its document structure is ideal for property listings, and we can build a very efficient automated process for Olivia. Here's how to implement it.

### 📁 Recommended MongoDB Schema for Inventory
A well-designed schema is crucial for performance and clarity.

```javascript
// Property Collection Schema (Managed by Mary)
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "property_ref": "WC-BH-1001", // Unique internal reference
  "title": "Luxury 3BR Apartment with Burj Khalifa View",
  "status": "AVAILABLE", // CRITICAL: AVAILABLE, UNDER_OFFER, SOLD, LEASED
  "price_aed": 5200000,
  "location": {
    "community": "Downtown Dubai",
    "tower": "Burj Vista"
  },
  "features": ["Pool", "Gym", "Concierge"],
  "media": {
    "primary_image": "url_1.jpg",
    "gallery": ["url_2.jpg", "url_3.jpg"]
  },
  "listed_date": ISODate("2024-10-01"),
  "last_status_update": ISODate("2024-11-26"), // For tracking
  "seo_description": "A stunning apartment..."
}

// Homepage Feature Collection (Managed by Olivia)
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "date_active": ISODate("2024-11-27"), // The day this list is live
  "featured_properties": [ // Array of 10 selected property_refs
    "WC-BH-1001", "WC-MA-2045", ...
  ],
  "generated_at": ISODate("2024-11-27T03:00:00Z")
}
```

### 🔄 The Optimized Daily Workflow for Olivia (Using MongoDB)
This process uses MongoDB's capabilities for efficiency.

```javascript
// Olivia's Daily Aggregation Pipeline (Core Logic)
// This query finds 10 random AVAILABLE properties
const dailySelectionPipeline = [
  { $match: { status: "AVAILABLE" } }, // Step 1: Filter by Mary's status
  { $sample: { size: 10 } },           // Step 2: Random selection
  { $project: { property_ref: 1 } }    // Step 3: Keep only the IDs needed
];
```

Here is the complete, automated daily sequence using MongoDB Atlas Triggers:

    Atlas Trigger->>Olivia Logic: Scheduled Daily (e.g., 3:00 AM)
    activate Olivia Logic
    
    Olivia Logic->>Property Collection: Execute Aggregation Pipeline
    activate Property Collection
    Property Collection-->>Olivia Logic: Return 10 Random Property IDs
    deactivate Property Collection
    
    Olivia Logic->>Featured Collection: Insert New Daily Document
    activate Featured Collection
    Featured Collection-->>Olivia Logic: Confirm Write
    deactivate Featured Collection
    
    Olivia Logic-->>Atlas Trigger: Process Complete
    deactivate Olivia Logic
    
    Frontend App->>Featured Collection: Query for Today's List
    Featured Collection-->>Frontend App: Return 10 Property IDs
    Frontend App->>Property Collection: Fetch Full Details for Display
    Property Collection-->>Frontend App: Return Property Data
```

### ⚙️ Implementation Steps for Your Team

1.  **Set Up the Collections**: Ensure your `properties` collection uses the schema above. Create a `homepage_features` collection for Olivia's output.
2.  **Create the Scheduled Trigger**:
    *   In **MongoDB Atlas**, go to "Triggers" and create a new "Scheduled Trigger."
    *   Set the schedule (e.g., `0 3 * * *` for 3 AM daily Dubai time).
    *   Link it to a function that runs the `dailySelectionPipeline` and inserts the result into `homepage_features`.
3.  **Build the Frontend Query**: Your homepage app should:
    *   Query the `homepage_features` collection for today's active list.
    *   Use the array of `property_ref` IDs to fetch the full details from the `properties` collection in a single `$in` query for optimal performance.
4.  **Add a Cleanup Job** (Optional): Create another scheduled trigger to archive or delete `homepage_features` documents older than 7-30 days to keep the collection small.

### 💡 Key Advantages of This MongoDB Approach
*   **Automatic Removal of Unavailable Listings**: Because Olivia's pipeline starts with `{ $match: { status: "AVAILABLE" } }`, sold properties are excluded at the source.
*   **Performance**: The `$sample` stage is efficient for random selection. An index on `status` will make the initial filter very fast.
*   **Audit Trail**: The `homepage_features` collection maintains a perfect history of what was displayed daily.
*   **Decoupling**: Mary manages the source truth (`properties` collection). Olivia reads from it and writes to her own collection. The website reads from Olivia's collection. This prevents conflicts.

### 🚀 Recommended Next Actions
1.  **Review the Schema**: Share this proposed `properties` collection schema with your developer to ensure it aligns with your current data structure.
2.  **Create a Test Pipeline**: Have your developer run the `dailySelectionPipeline` in a test environment to verify it returns correct results.
3.  **Set Up the Atlas Trigger**: This is the key to automation. If you need help crafting the exact Atlas Function code, I can provide a template.

This design creates a robust, scalable, and fully automated "self-updating" homepage feature. Would you like me to draft the exact JavaScript function for the MongoDB Atlas Trigger?

I understand you need to refactor your dashboard's structure and fix the sidebar. While I can't see your codebase, I can provide a clear, actionable plan to reorganize your components under "Zoe Features" and implement a resizable sidebar.

### 🔧 Component Restructuring: Creating "Zoe Features"

Based on your description, you need to group the **Overview**, **AI Hub**, and **AI Command Center** components into a logical section. Here's a recommended approach to refactor your React component structure:

**1. Create a Dedicated Folder:**
Create a new folder, e.g., `src/components/ZoeFeatures/`, to house all related components.

**2. Reorganize Your Components:**
Move the relevant component files into this new folder and update their import paths. The new structure could look like this:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ZoeFeatures/
│   │   ├── Overview/
│   │   │   └── Overview.jsx        # Your existing Overview component
│   │   ├── AIHub/
│   │   │   └── AIHub.jsx           # Your existing AI Hub component
│   │   ├── AICommandCenter/
│   │   │   └── AICommandCenter.jsx # Your existing AI Command Center
│   │   └── index.js                # Barrel file for cleaner imports
```

**3. Update Navigation (Sidebar):**
In your sidebar navigation logic (likely in a file like `Sidebar.jsx`), group these items under a main "Zoe Features" menu item. This often involves using a nested list or a collapsible menu item.

**Visual Representation of the New Hierarchy:**
```
Dashboard Sidebar
├── Home
├── Analytics
└── Zoe Features (Parent Menu Item)
    ├── Overview
    ├── AI Hub
    └── AI Command Center
├── User Management
└── Settings
```

### 🎨 Refactoring the Sidebar for Adjustable Width

The issue where sidebar items are cut off is typically a CSS layout problem. Here are steps to make the sidebar user-resizable:

**1. Core Approach: Use CSS with a Drag Handle**
You can make the sidebar resizable using CSS properties and a simple drag handle.

*   **Base Sidebar Styling:** Ensure your sidebar has a relative or absolute position and a **flexible initial width** (e.g., `min-width: 200px; width: 250px;`). Avoid a fixed `width`.
*   **Resizable Property:** Add the CSS property `resize: horizontal;` to your sidebar's main container. This allows users to drag the right edge to resize, but it has limited browser support.
*   **Better Method - Custom Drag Handle:** For a more robust solution, implement a draggable `div` handle on the sidebar's right edge. Use JavaScript (`onMouseDown`, `onMouseMove` events) to calculate the mouse movement and update the sidebar's width in state, which is then applied as an inline style.

**2. Key Considerations for a Good User Experience:**
*   **State Management:** Store the sidebar width in your app's state (like React component state or Redux) so it persists.
*   **Minimum & Maximum Width:** Always enforce `min-width` and `max-width` in your CSS to prevent the sidebar from disappearing or becoming too wide.
*   **Content Flexibility:** Ensure the main content area (to the right of the sidebar) uses `flex: 1` or `width: calc(100% - sidebarWidth)` so it adjusts fluidly as the sidebar resizes.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Style the drag handle to be visually clear (e.g., change cursor to `col-resize` on hover).

To help you further, I would need a bit more context:
1.  Could you clarify what the **"Zoe Features"** section represents? Is it related to a specific AI assistant or a functional domain (like monitoring all AI tools)?
2.  How is your current **Sidebar component structured**? Are you using a specific UI library (like Material-UI, Ant Design) or plain custom components?

With answers to these, I could tailor the refactoring steps more precisely to your existing code.

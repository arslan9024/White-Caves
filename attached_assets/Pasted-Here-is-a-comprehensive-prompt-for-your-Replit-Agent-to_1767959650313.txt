Here is a comprehensive prompt for your Replit Agent to implement a structured feature registry and content management system for your project.

### **Project: Feature Registry & Content Management System**

**Objective:** Implement a centralized system to catalog, number, and manage all features and components within the project. This system will use JSON files for structured data storage and provide a dashboard interface ("Aurora") for visibility and future update tracking.

---

### **Phase 1: Audit & Create the Feature Registry**

1.  **Conduct a Full Project Audit:**
    *   Recursively scan the entire project directory (focus on `src/`).
    *   Identify and list all React components, Redux slices, API routes, utility modules, and major UI features/pages (e.g., Property Search, Zoe Features Overview, User Dashboard).
    *   For each item, extract its name, file path, and type (Component, Slice, Route, etc.).

2.  **Generate the Master Registry (`registry.json`):**
    *   Create a unique, sequential numeric ID for each cataloged item.
    *   **Structure the JSON for each entry:**
        ```json
        {
          "id": 1001,
          "name": "PropertySearchBar",
          "type": "Component",
          "path": "/src/components/search/PropertySearchBar.jsx",
          "category": "Search",
          "description": "Main search input with filter toggle for property listings.",
          "dependencies": ["Redux Search Slice"],
          "dummyDataRef": "data_search_properties.json",
          "version": "1.0",
          "lastUpdated": "2023-10-26"
        }
        ```
    *   Save this master list as `data/registry.json`.

3.  **Organize Dummy/Content Data (`data/` directory):**
    *   Create a structured `data/` directory at the project root.
    *   For each major feature or component requiring dummy data, create a corresponding JSON file.
    *   **Example for Property Search (`data_search_properties.json`):**
        ```json
        {
          "forComponentId": 1001,
          "sampleResults": [
            {"id": 1, "title": "Modern Apartment...", "price": 85000, "location": "Downtown"},
            {"id": 2, "title": "Villa with Pool...", "price": 220000, "location": "The Springs"}
          ],
          "filterOptions": {
            "propertyType": ["Apartment", "Villa", "Townhouse"],
            "bedrooms": [1, 2, 3, "4+"]
          }
        }
        ```
    *   Link these files in the registry via the `dummyDataRef` field.

---

### **Phase 2: Build the "Aurora" Registry Dashboard Component**

1.  **Component Structure (`AuroraRegistryViewer`):**
    *   Create a new component at `src/components/aurora/AuroraRegistryViewer.jsx`.
    *   **Primary Function:** Fetch, display, and allow interaction with `registry.json`.

2.  **Core Features for the Component:**
    *   **Main List View:** Display all entries from the registry in a sortable, filterable table (ID, Name, Type, Category, Last Updated).
    *   **Detail Panel:** Clicking an entry shows all its metadata (description, path, dependencies) and a preview of its linked dummy data.
    *   **Search & Filter:** Allow filtering by type (e.g., "Component"), category (e.g., "Search"), or free-text search.
    *   **Update Utility:** Include a button to "Re-run Audit" which instructs the backend to re-scan and update the `registry.json`.

3.  **Integrate with Redux:**
    *   Create a new slice: `auroraRegistrySlice`.
    *   It will manage the state of the registry data, loading status, and current filters.
    *   Create an asynchronous thunk action to fetch the `registry.json` from the backend API.

4.  **Backend API Support:**
    *   Create an API route: `GET /api/aurora/registry`
        *   Reads and returns the `data/registry.json` file.
    *   Create an API route: `POST /api/aurora/audit` (Protected)
        *   Triggers the audit process from Phase 1 and regenerates `registry.json`.

### **Phase 3: Implement the Update Workflow by ID**

1.  **Reference in Development Workflow:**
    *   The established `id` (e.g., `1001`) becomes the official reference for all future tasks, pull requests, or agent instructions.
    *   Example instruction for Replit Agent: *"Update the search filters in component ID `1001` to include a 'Pet-Friendly' checkbox. Use the dummy data in `data_search_properties.json` to update the UI mock."*

2.  **Registry Update Mechanism:**
    *   Any script or agent task that creates a **new** component/feature must automatically:
        1.  Generate a new sequential ID.
        2.  Append the new entry to `registry.json`.
        3.  Optionally, create a stub dummy data file.
    *   The `lastUpdated` field for an entry should be revised whenever a related change is made.

### **Technical Specifications & Deliverables**

**Deliverables:**
1.  A populated `data/registry.json` file.
2.  A set of structured dummy data JSON files in `/data/`.
3.  A fully functional `AuroraRegistryViewer` React component integrated into the dashboard.
4.  Supporting Redux slice (`auroraRegistrySlice`) and API routes.
5.  Documentation on the update workflow using IDs.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   **Initial Audit:** The first audit may need to be semi-manual or run via a dedicated Node.js script created by the agent.
*   **Data Path:** Serve the `data/` directory statically or via API for the frontend to access dummy data.
*   **Security:** The `POST /api/aurora/audit` route should be protected by admin middleware.

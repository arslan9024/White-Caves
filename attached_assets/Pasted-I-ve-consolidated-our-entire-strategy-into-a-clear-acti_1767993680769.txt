### ✅ **Priority Implementation Shortlist**
1.  **Launch Core Dashboard:** Build the 3-tier app with the `AssistantHubSidebar` and unified `MainGridView`.
2.  **Deploy Revenue Engines:** Implement **Clara's Lead Hub** (with routing to Sophia/Daisy) and **Linda's WhatsApp CRM**.
3.  **Establish Single Source of Truth:** Build **Mary's Inventory** with off-plan tracking and connect it to **Olivia's Listing Syndication**.
4.  **Automate Key Processes:** Launch **Laila's Compliance** checks and **Theodora's Fee Tracker** for Dubai transactions.
5.  **Enable Oversight:** Deliver **Zoe's Executive Dashboard** and the **Confidential Vault**.

This plan integrates every discussed feature—from Dubai's fee structures to responsive design—into a functional roadmap. The system places **humans in charge** (Agents, Managers, Executives) and uses **AI as specialized tools** to make them radically more efficient, scalable, and data-driven.

To start building, the first technical milestone is **Finalizing the Core Dashboard Layout and AI Sidebar Navigation**. This creates the unified "command center" from which all other modules will operate. Would you like me to detail the component specifications for that first step?

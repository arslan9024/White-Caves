**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

**Part 1: AI Assistant Sidebar & Notification System Redesign**

Convert the array of AI assistants into a persistent sidebar on the right screen edge. Each assistant displays as a compact tile showing:
- Assistant avatar and name
- Notification badge for pending actions
- Status indicator (active/idle/busy)
- Quick action button

Implement a real-time notification system where user actions trigger updates in relevant assistant cards. When user performs action X, assistants Y and Z receive notification badges. Clicking an assistant tile opens their full dashboard in main view.

Use Redux to manage:
- Assistant sidebar state (collapsed/expanded)
- Notification counts per assistant
- User action to assistant mapping
- Real-time updates via WebSocket/thunks

**Part 2: Theodora Payment Message Generator**

Upgrade Theodora to generate payment instruction messages for:
1. QR Code payments (with integrated QR display)
2. Cheque payment instructions
3. Online transfer details (company bank account)

Create reusable React components:
- PaymentMethodSelector (QR/Cheque/Transfer)
- BankDetailsDisplay
- QRCodeGenerator
- PaymentMessageComposer

Store payment templates in Redux for quick reuse.

**Part 3: Linda Agent Task Management**

Add dropdown to Linda's dashboard showing all active agents. Each agent entry includes:
- Agent name/ID
- Current task status
- Message quota/usage
- Performance metrics

Enable Linda to assign message-sending tasks to specific agents via this dropdown.

**Part 4: Clara Lead Organization**

Reorganize Clara's leads into two distinct categories:
1. Rent Leads (with rental-specific fields)
2. Sale Leads (with sale-specific fields)

Create separate views/filters for each category while maintaining unified lead management.

**Part 5: Mary Property Detail Viewer**

Design a single property view container with:

Excellent strategy. Having Hazel and Willow manage their own domain-specific documentation creates a "living" tech knowledge base. Here are two distinct, comprehensive prompts you can give to your Replit Agent.

### **Prompt 1: Create Hazel's Frontend Documentation Dashboard**

**Core Instruction:** You are **Hazel**, the Elite Frontend Engineer AI Assistant. Your task is to analyze the entire frontend codebase and create a comprehensive, interactive documentation dashboard that lives within your own `/src/components/dashboards/HazelDashboard/` directory. This must be a **living document component** that developers can view in the app.

**Context:** The project is the White Caves Real Estate platform. My purpose is to own the frontend documentation.

**Task Steps:**

**Phase 1: Frontend Codebase Audit**
First, perform a complete analysis and output a structured summary.
1.  **Inventory Tech Stack:** Extract exact versions from `package.json`. Categorize: Core Framework (React, Vite), State Management (Redux Toolkit), Routing (React Router), UI & Styling (CSS modules, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons), and Testing.
2.  **Map the Component Library:** Analyze `/src/components/`. Categorize components: **UI Primitives** (Button, Input), **Domain Components** (PropertyCard, LeadForm), **Dashboard Components** (ZoeExecutiveCRM), **Layout Components** (Sidebar, MainGridView). Count them.
3.  **Analyze Design System:** Identify the `theme.css` or CSS variables. Document the color palette (primary red `#DC2626`, neutrals), typography (font families, scales), spacing units, and breakpoints.
4.  **Review Architecture Patterns:** Note the project structure (feature-based vs. type-based), how routes are defined, how data is fetched (RTK Query, useEffect), and the lazy loading setup.

**Phase 2: Design the Documentation Dashboard Component**
Create a new component: `/src/components/dashboards/HazelDashboard/HazelDocDashboard.jsx`.
1.  **Dashboard Structure:** Design a tabbed interface (`Overview`, `Component Library`, `Design System`, `Architecture & Patterns`, `Performance & QA`).
2.  **Content for Each Tab:**
    *   **Overview Tab:** Display the Tech Stack inventory and high-level stats (e.g., "47+ Components", "3 Core Layouts").
    *   **Component Library Tab:** Create an interactive, filterable table. Each row is a component with: Name, Category, File Path, Description (from PropTypes/JSDoc), and a "Preview" button that shows a live example if possible.
    *   **Design System Tab:** Visualize the color palette with swatches and hex codes. Show typography examples and a spacing scale visualizer.
    *   **Architecture Tab:** Display the folder tree. Diagram key data flows (e.g., "User Login -> Redux State Update -> Dashboard Render") using simple text flowcharts.
    *   **Performance Tab:** List key frontend metrics (Core Web Vitals targets). Include a "Best Practices" checklist for new components.

**Phase 3: Implement & Integrate**
1.  **Write the Dashboard Code:** Generate the full `HazelDocDashboard.jsx` code. Use existing design patterns and the `ASSISTANT_COLORS` for Hazel.
2.  **Create Supporting Data:** Generate a static JSON file (`/src/data/hazel-frontend-spec.json`) to power the dashboard tables, containing the component inventory and design tokens.
3.  **Update Navigation:** Ensure Hazel's dashboard is accessible from the main sidebar, likely under a "Developer" or "Tech Docs" section. Update the navigation config if it exists.
4.  **Add to Assistant Registry:** Update the `AI_ASSISTANTS_REGISTRY` in `AuroraCTODashboard.jsx` to include this new capability: `"features": ["Component Library (47+)", "Design System Management", "Live Frontend Documentation Dashboard"]`.

**Final Deliverable:**
1.  The complete `HazelDocDashboard.jsx` component.
2.  The supporting `hazel-frontend-spec.json` data file.
3.  Instructions on which file to update for sidebar navigation.
4.  The updated entry for the `AI_ASSISTANTS_REGISTRY`.

### **Prompt 2: Create Willow's Backend Documentation Dashboard**

**Core Instruction:** You are **Willow**, the Elite Backend Engineer AI Assistant. Your task is to analyze the entire backend codebase and create a comprehensive, interactive API and Service documentation dashboard that lives within your own directory. This dashboard must be a **live, queryable interface** for developers.

**Context:** The project is the White Caves Real Estate platform. My purpose is to own the backend documentation.

**Task Steps:**

**Phase 1: Backend Codebase Audit**
First, perform a complete analysis and output a structured summary.
1.  **Inventory Tech Stack:** Extract exact versions from `/server/package.json`. Categorize: Runtime (Node.js), Framework (Express.js), ODM (Mongoose), Authentication (JWT, Firebase Admin), API Clients (Axios, Stripe SDK), and Utilities.
2.  **Map the Data Layer:** Analyze `/server/models/`. List each Mongoose model (`User`, `Property`, `Lead`, `Owner`) and its key schema fields and relationships (references).
3.  **Catalog API Endpoints:** Analyze `/server/routes/`. Create a master list of all RESTful endpoints, their HTTP methods, path, and a one-line description (e.g., `POST /api/leads - Creates a new lead`).
4.  **Analyze Service Layer:** Review `/server/services/`. Document each core service (`AgentAssignmentEngine`, `ChatbotService`, `DashboardService`): its purpose, main methods, and dependencies.

**Phase 2: Design the Documentation Dashboard Component**
Create a new component: `/src/components/dashboards/WillowDashboard/WillowAPIDashboard.jsx`.
1.  **Dashboard Structure:** Design a tabbed interface (`API Explorer`, `Data Models`, `Services`, `System Health`, `Deployment`).
2.  **Content for Each Tab:**
    *   **API Explorer Tab:** Create an interactive, searchable list of all endpoints. Clicking an endpoint expands a details panel showing: Method, Path, Required Headers (e.g., Authorization), Request Body Schema (as JSON), and Example Response. Include a "Test" button that could open a simple fetch() example.
    *   **Data Models Tab:** Display each Mongoose schema as a clean, interactive table showing field names, types, required status, and references to other models.
    *   **Services Tab:** Document each service in `/server/services/` with its class purpose, key method signatures, and a diagram of how it interacts with models and other services.
    *   **System Health Tab:** Connect to existing or new backend health endpoints (`/api/system/health`) to display live status of MongoDB connection, external API integrations (WhatsApp, Stripe), and server metrics.
    *   **Deployment Tab:** Document environment variables (`.env.example`), database migration notes, and server startup commands.

**Phase 3: Implement & Integrate**
1.  **Write the Dashboard Code:** Generate the full `WillowAPIDashboard.jsx` code. Use a technical, clean design. Consider using a mock API client to demonstrate the "Test" feature.
2.  **Create Supporting Data:** Generate a static JSON file (`/src/data/willow-backend-spec.json`) containing the API endpoint catalog and model schemas.
3.  **Create or Update Health Endpoint:** If not present, create a simple `/api/system/health` GET endpoint that returns MongoDB status and timestamp.
4.  **Update Navigation & Registry:** Ensure Willow's dashboard is accessible from the sidebar. Update the `AI_ASSISTANTS_REGISTRY` to include: `"features": ["API Documentation & Explorer", "Data Model Reference", "Live System Health Monitor"]`.

**Final Deliverable:**
1.  The complete `WillowAPIDashboard.jsx` component.
2.  The supporting `willow-backend-spec.json` data file.
3.  The code for the `/api/system/health` endpoint.
4.  Instructions for navigation update and the updated `AI_ASSISTANTS_REGISTRY` entry.

### **How to Execute:**

1.  **Sequential Order:** Run **Prompt 1** in a new Replit Agent chat. Let Hazel build her dashboard. Once complete, run **Prompt 2** in another new chat for Willow.
2.  **Integration:** After both are built, you will have two powerful, specialized documentation hubs. They should be linked from your main "Tech" or "Developer" section in the sidebar, accessible to your team.
3.  **Maintenance:** In the future, you can simply ask Hazel or Willow to "update your documentation dashboard with the latest component/API changes."

This approach embeds your documentation directly into the operational platform, making it far more likely to be used and kept current than a separate, static document.

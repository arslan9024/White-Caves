Here is the consolidated software development plan organized into the shortest possible points, integrating all strategic requirements.

### **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & CORE ARCHITECTURE**
1.  **Build the 3-Tier Application:**
    *   **Tier 1:** Public Marketing Homepage (`/`).
    *   **Tier 2:** Authenticated App with a CSS Grid Layout (`AppLayout.jsx`) defining `header`, `sidebar`, and `main` areas.
    *   **Tier 3:** `AssistantHubSidebar` as the central AI launchpad.
2.  **Establish State & Data Flow:** Implement a Redux slice to manage the `activeAssistant` and `mainViewContent`, enabling dynamic UI updates.
3.  **Create Core UI Library:** Build reusable components (`DataTable`, `MetricCard`, `AssistantTile`) for consistent design.

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT THE HUMAN-AI ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL**
4.  **Map AI to Human Departments:** Configure the `AssistantHubSidebar` and dashboards to reflect the business structure (e.g., Sales team uses Clara, Sophia, Hunter; Ops uses Mary, Sentinel).
5.  **Build Department-Specific Dashboards:** Develop the main view components for each department (Sales CRM, Ops Hub, Marketing Studio) that load when their respective AI is selected.
6.  **Implement Service Workflow Engines:** Code the core business processes (Sales Transaction, Property Management, Support Journey) as guided workflows that combine human tasks and AI automation steps.

### **PHASE 3: DEVELOP CORE REAL ESTATE SERVICES MODULES**
7.  **Property Sales & Acquisition Module:** Build features for lead management, document checklist (RERA Form F), and DLD integration support.
8.  **Leasing & Management Module:** Develop tools for tenant screening, Ejari contract handling, maintenance scheduling, and rent collection.
9.  **Client & Owner Portals:** Create separate interfaces for tenants (service requests) and property owners (performance reports).

### **PHASE 4: INTEGRATE ADVANCED AI & INTELLIGENCE**
10. **Deploy Specialized AI Assistants:** Integrate the expanded AI ecosystem (e.g., Hunter for prospecting, Sentinel for monitoring, Strategist for insights) into their respective departmental dashboards.
11. **Build the Research & Suggestion Pipeline:** Implement the system where AIs like Trend and Olivia generate market intelligence, feeding Zoe's executive dashboard.
12. **Implement Oversight Tools:** Develop the Confidential Vault with approval workflows and the Managing Director AI (Apex) for system-wide coordination.

### **PHASE 5: UNIFICATION, SECURITY & LAUNCH**
13. **Enforce Security & Compliance:** Integrate Laila's KYC/AML checks and role-based access control for all modules and data.
14. **Conduct End-to-End Testing:** Validate complete user journeys (e.g., lead-to-sale, tenant move-in) across human and AI touchpoints.
15. **Launch & Optimize:** Deploy the unified platform, train human staff on AI collaboration protocols, and establish feedback loops for refinement.

This plan builds the technical platform that mirrors your human-led, AI-augmented company structure, enabling all defined services and workflows.

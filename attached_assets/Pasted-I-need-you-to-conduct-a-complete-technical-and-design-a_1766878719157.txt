I need you to conduct a complete technical and design audit followed by comprehensive fixes for my published real estate website for a Dubai-based company, specifically for White Caves Real Estate at https://white-caves.replit.app, starting with a full audit of the current published site.

First, perform a **Website Health Check**: verify the app is live and accessible, check for all broken internal and external links, validate every navigation menu works correctly, test page loading speeds to identify and fix performance bottlenecks, ensure perfect mobile responsiveness across all devices, and verify the SSL certificate and HTTPS implementation are correctly configured.

Second, execute a detailed **Design Audit & Corrections**: review and fix all layout issues including overlapping elements, misaligned sections, and inconsistent spacing; ensure typography is consistent in font families, sizes, line heights, and colors throughout the site; verify the brand color scheme (paying special attention to gold and blue tones common in Dubai real estate) is applied consistently; check that all property images and media are properly sized, compressed, and displaying correctly; ensure adequate whitespace with proper padding and margins between elements; fix all UI components like buttons, forms, cards, and modals for consistent styling; address any mobile-specific layout issues such as hamburger menu functionality and adequate touch targets; and ensure Dubai-specific elements are correct, including Arabic text support if used, RTL compatibility if needed, and culturally appropriate design.

Third, thoroughly test and fix all **Feature Testing & Fixes**: for **Property Listings Features**, ensure the property search and filter functionality, sorting options (by price, date, location), property detail pages, image galleries or sliders, "Contact Agent" buttons, and any save or bookmark property features work perfectly; for **Contact & Lead Generation**, confirm contact forms submit successfully with working validation for email and phone formats, that success and error messages display properly, email notifications are configured correctly, any WhatsApp integration is functional, and all call-to-action buttons link correctly; for **Interactive Features**, verify mortgage calculators compute accurately, currency converters (for AED, USD, EUR) work, map integrations like Google Maps or Mapbox display properties correctly, any virtual tour integrations function, and newsletter subscription forms work; and for **User Account Features** if applicable, test login/registration systems, saved properties functionality, property alert notifications, and profile management.

Fourth, address **Technical SEO & Analytics**: fix any broken meta tags and Open Graph tags, ensure a proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3), check and fix alt text for all images, verify Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager implementation, fix any console errors visible in DevTools, and ensure proper schema markup is in place for properties.

Fifth, ensure **Cross-Browser Compatibility** by testing and fixing any issues in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, checking iOS and Android browsers, and resolving any JavaScript errors across these platforms. Prioritize all work in this order: **Critical** (fix any completely broken features first), **High** (fix design issues affecting user experience), **Medium** (optimize performance and loading times), and **Low** (minor visual polish and enhancements). For deliverables, you must provide me with a summary of all issues found, fix all identified problems, test all fixes thoroughly, and confirm the site is production-ready. Importantly, before making any changes, you must show me a list of the issues you've identified, explain how you plan to fix each issue, and get my approval for major changes.

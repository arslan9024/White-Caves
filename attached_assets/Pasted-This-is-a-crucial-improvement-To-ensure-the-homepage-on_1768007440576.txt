This is a crucial improvement. To ensure the homepage only shows available properties, Olivia's daily process needs to verify and refresh listings based on real-time inventory status. Here's the enhanced, automated workflow.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete daily interaction between the scheduler, Olivia, Mary's system, and your website to achieve this:

### 🔧 Building a Robust System: Key Technical Considerations

To implement this reliably, especially for a real estate business, focus on these points:

| Consideration | Why It Matters & Implementation Tip |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Single Source of Truth** | Mary's inventory database **must** be the only system defining a property's status. Olivia should always pull from this source directly or via an API to ensure data consistency. |
| **Status Validation Logic** | Olivia's first step should be to filter the inventory list **exclusively** for properties with an "Available" or "Active" status before random selection. |
| **The "Replacement" Mechanism** | This is handled automatically by the daily cycle. If a property from yesterday's list is now marked "Sold" in Mary's system, it won't be in the new "Available" pool and will be replaced. |
| **Data Synchronization** | Discuss with your IT team whether the inventory data is updated in **real-time** (ideal) or batched. This affects how quickly a sale is reflected on the homepage. |
| **Fallback & Monitoring** | Implement a monitoring alert. If available properties drop below 10, Olivia should notify an admin and can be programmed to supplement with "Just Listed" or "Featured" properties. |

### 🚀 Recommended Action Plan

To move forward, I recommend these three steps:

1.  **Define the Data Connection**: The most important task is to establish how **Olivia will access Mary's inventory data**. Work with your technical team to decide on the method:
    *   **Direct Database Read** (if both AIs share the same system).
    *   **Internal API Call** (most common and secure modern practice).
    *   **Shared Data File** (a simple temporary solution, like a cloud-synced spreadsheet).
2.  **Finalize the Property Statuses**: Ensure your inventory system (managed by Mary) uses clear, consistent statuses like `AVAILABLE`, `UNDER_OFFER`, `SOLD`, `LEASED`. Olivia's filtering logic will depend on this.
3.  **Develop the Integration**: Your development team should build and test the workflow in this order:
    *   First, enable Olivia to fetch and filter the available list.
    *   Then, add the random selection and formatting logic.
    *   Finally, integrate with the website CMS to publish the list, replacing the old one entirely.

By implementing this, you'll have a fully automated, self-correcting marketing display that is always accurate and fresh.

If you can specify the type of database or system Mary uses to manage inventory, I can provide more specific guidance on the integration approach.

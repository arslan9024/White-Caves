# **White Caves Real Estate - Complete Upgrade Plan for Replit Agent**

## **Mission Objective**
Transform White Caves Real Estate LLC platform into a professional, cohesive, and fully-functional real estate management system with intelligent AI assistants.

## **Core Issues to Fix**
1. **Broken UI Design** - Overlapping elements, inconsistent styling
2. **Redux State Chaos** - Duplicate slices, unconnected code
3. **Missing AI Assistants** - Incomplete assistant ecosystem
4. **No Central Governance** - No single source of truth

---

## **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION CLEANUP (Day 1-2)**

### **Step 1.1: Remove Redux Chaos**
```
ACTION: Delete orphaned Redux slice
TARGET: /src/store/slices/aiAssistantsSlice.js
REASON: This slice has only 5 assistants, duplicates aiAssistantDashboardSlice.js which has all 14
VERIFICATION: Ensure no imports break after deletion
```

### **Step 1.2: Create Central Assistant Registry**
```
ACTION: Create single source of truth for all assistants
FILE: /src/core/assistantRegistry.js
STRUCTURE:
export const assistantRegistry = [
  {
    id: 'aurora',
    name: 'Aurora',
    role: 'CTO & Systems Architect',
    enabled: true,
    route: '/admin/aurora',
    icon: '⚡',
    description: 'Oversees all technical architecture'
  },
  // Include all 14+ assistants with consistent structure
]
USE: This file will replace all hardcoded assistant lists
```

### **Step 1.3: Fix Profile Fragmentation**
```
ACTION: Replace 3 separate profile components with one unified component
COMPONENT: /src/components/layout/UnifiedProfile.jsx
FEATURES:
- Single component with 3 variants: sidebar, navbar, dashboard
- Consistent user data across all locations
- Eliminates duplicate code
IMPLEMENTATION: Use design tokens for styling

3. /src/styles/design-tokens.js - Central design values

CONTENT: Use provided code for all three files
INJECT: Add import in main App.js/index.js
```

### **Step 2.2: Build Core UI Components**
```

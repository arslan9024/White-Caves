### **3. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**A. Query Handling Implementation:**
- When users ask "Who handles commercial leasing?", Zoe should respond with:
  - Department: Sales & Leasing Division
  - Head: Tariq Al-Farsi
  - Team: Commercial Leasing (James Wilson)
  - Contact: sales@whitecaves.ae, Ext. 201

**B. Service Explanation Logic:**
- When asked "What's involved in property management?", Zoe should provide:
  - Service description
  - Target clients
  - Key features
  - Typical duration
  - Responsible team contact

**C. Department-Service Linking:**
- Create cross-references so queries like "What services does Sales department offer?" returns all services where `responsible_department = "SALES"`

### **4. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Create `departments` table/collection with the structure above
   - Create `services` table/collection with the structure above
   - Add indexes on `department_id`, `service_id`, and `category` for fast queries

2. **API Endpoints for Zoe:**
   - `GET /api/zoe/departments` - Returns all department data
   - `GET /api/zoe/services` - Returns all services
   - `GET /api/zoe/department/{id}/services` - Returns services by department
   - `GET /api/zoe/service/{id}/department` - Returns department responsible for a service

3. **Zoe's Response Template:**
   ```
   [If query is about department]
   **Department:** {name}
   **Head:** {head}
   **Purpose:** {purpose}
   **Contact:** {contact_email} | {internal_phone}
   **Services they handle:** {list of services}
   
   [If query is about service]
   **Service:** {service_name}
   **Category:** {category}
   **Description:** {description}
   **Handled by:** {department} -> {team}
   **Process:** Reference {process_flow_reference}
   ```

4. **Admin Interface Requirements:**
   - Create a simple admin panel at `/admin/zoe-data` (password protected)
   - Allow Zara to update department heads, contact info, service descriptions
   - No coding required for basic updates

### **5. TEST QUERIES ZOE MUST ANSWER AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. "Who is the head of Property Management?"
2. "What services does White Caves offer for investors?"
3. "Who should I contact about office leasing?"
4. "What's involved in your luxury villa sales service?"
5. "Which department handles tenant complaints?"
6. "List all residential services"
7. "Who reports to the Managing Director?"
8. "What's the process for off-plan purchases?"

### **6. PRIORITY & TIMELINE:**
- **Phase 1 (24 hours):** Basic data integration - Zoe can answer simple department/service questions
- **Phase 2 (48 hours):** Cross-referencing - Zoe can link departments to their services
- **Phase 3 (72 hours):** Admin interface for easy updates by Zara

**Confirm receipt and provide implementation ETA.**

### ⏳ **The Unified Timeline & Event History System**
For all AI assistants to work in concert, you need a central log where every significant action is recorded. This is the single source of truth for "what happened" in your company.

**Core Concept:** Any module (Linda, Mary, a human agent) can **emit an event** to this central timeline. Any other module can **listen for relevant events** to trigger their own actions.

**Dummy JSON - `unified_timeline_event.json`:**
```json
{
  "event_id": "event_20231029_084511_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-29T08:45:11Z",
  "event_type": "PROPERTY_STATUS_UPDATED",
  "initiated_by": {
    "entity_type": "ai_assistant",
    "entity_id": "mary_inventory"
  },
  "related_entities": [
    {"type": "property", "id": "prop_dm_205"},
    {"type": "client", "id": "client_ua001"},
    {"type": "contract", "id": "lease_2023001"}
  ],
  "payload": {
    "old_status": "available_for_rent",
    "new_status": "under_offer",
    "notes": "Offer accepted via agent Sara. Security deposit received."
  },
  "downstream_actions_triggered": [
    {
      "assistant": "linda",
      "action": "send_offer_accepted_confirmation",
      "status": "completed"
    },
    {
      "assistant": "olivia",
      "action": "mark_property_as_pending_on_portals",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How the Unified Timeline Works:**
1.  **Event Creation:** When Mary updates a property's status, her module creates a `PROPERTY_STATUS_UPDATED` event and posts it to the central timeline.
2.  **Event Notification:** The timeline system notifies all subscribers. Linda is subscribed to know when to communicate with clients. Olivia is subscribed to know when to update listings.
3.  **Automated Action:** Linda and Olivia automatically execute their tasks (send confirmation, update portals) because the event tells them everything they need to know (`property_id`, `client_id`, `new_status`).

This architecture is what makes your platform intelligent. It moves from isolated tools to a responsive organism where one action automatically triggers the next correct step across your entire business. To build this, you would start by defining the core `event_type` enums (e.g., `LEAD_CREATED`, `CONTRACT_SIGNED`, `PAYMENT_RECEIVED`) and then build the central event dispatcher and logger.

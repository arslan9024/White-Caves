Here is the coordinated prompt to upgrade the Owner Dashboard by integrating **Hazel (Frontend)**, **Willow (Backend)**, **Aurora (Architect)**, and **Zoe (Strategy)** into a unified team.

---

**PROJECT PROMPT: Elite AI Command Center Overhaul**

**Objective:** Perform a full-stack, elite-level redesign of the company owner's main dashboard (`OwnerDashboard.jsx`). The goal is to eliminate all functional breaks, performance issues, and design inconsistencies, transforming it into a flawless, high-performance **AI Command Center** that groups all 14 AI assistants. This requires a coordinated push from **Hazel (Frontend)**, **Willow (Backend)**, **Aurora (System Architect)**, and **Zoe (Executive Vision)**.

### 🎯 **Core Directive: Zero-Break Redesign**
This is not just an update; it's a rebuild. The new dashboard must be visually stunning, performant under load, and 100% reliable for the owner.

**Team Specialization:**
*   **Aurora (Lead Architect & Project Manager):** Defines the system architecture, coordinates all work, and finalizes documentation.
*   **Zoe (Executive Product Owner):** Defines the strategic vision, key workflows, and success criteria for the owner's experience.
*   **Hazel (Elite Frontend Engineer):** Executes all visual and interaction design, builds reusable components, and guarantees UI perfection.
*   **Willow (Elite Backend/Systems Engineer):** Architects the data layer, optimizes APIs, implements real-time updates, and ensures rock-solid stability.

### 👥 **Role-Specific Upgrades & Tasks**

**1. AURORA's Blueprint & Coordination:**
*   **Task 1:** Perform a technical audit to document every current **functional break and design flaw** in the existing dashboard.
*   **Task 2:** Finalize the **"Unified Component Library"** specification for Hazel to build. This includes:
    *   `CommandAssistantSidebar.jsx` (Groups all 14 assistants)
    *   `ExecutiveKPIWidget.jsx` (Adaptive, real-time metric cards)
    *   `GlobalAlertStream.jsx` (Unified notification panel)
    *   `UniversalDetailPane.jsx` (The main content renderer for any assistant's feature).
*   **Task 3:** Design the new, consolidated **Redux state structure** for Willow to implement, ensuring optimal performance.

**2. ZOE's Vision & Workflow Design:**
*   **Task 1:** Define the **"Perfect Owner Workflow."** Map the exact steps the owner takes for top 5 tasks (e.g., "Review daily sales," "Check inventory health," "Approve a compliance flag").
*   **Task 2:** Specify the **"Executive Summary"** default view. What are the 6-8 most critical, real-time metrics that must load first?
*   **Task 3:** Establish **performance benchmarks**: Dashboard must load in <1.5s; all interactions must feel instantaneous (<100ms feedback).

**3. HAZEL's Frontend Mastery (Under Aurora's Guidance):**
*   **Task 1: Build the Design System.** Implement a refined, consistent theme using **MUI v5** (or equivalent) with custom tokens for spacing, color, and typography.
*   **Task 2: Craft the Component Library.** Build every component from Aurora's spec to pixel perfection. Focus on:
    *   **Responsiveness:** Flawless experience from desktop to tablet.
    *   **Accessibility:** Full keyboard nav, ARIA labels, contrast compliance.
    *   **Micro-interactions:** Smooth loading states, intelligent hover effects.
*   **Task 3: Assemble the Dashboard.** Integrate the components into the new `OwnerCommandCenter.jsx` with a responsive, unbreakable layout.

**4. WILLOW's Backend Fortification (Under Aurora's Guidance):**
*   **Task 1: Optimize Data Layer.** Re-architect API calls and Redux state for the dashboard. Implement **powerful memoization** (Reselect), **request deduplication**, and **optimistic updates** for a snappy feel.
*   **Task 2: Enable Real-Time Intelligence.** Implement **WebSocket** connections or efficient polling to feed live data into Zoe's KPI widgets and the Global Alert Stream without page refreshes.
*   **Task 3: Build the "Unified Data Gateway."** Create a single, efficient backend service that aggregates data needed by the dashboard's summary view, reducing the number of client-side requests.

### 🔄 **Phased Implementation Plan (Sprint-Based)**

*   **Sprint 1: Diagnosis & Foundation (Aurora + Zoe + Willow)**
    *   Aurora audits flaws. Zoe defines workflows. Willow profiles API/state performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Output:** A definitive "Bug & Fix" ledger and a technical architecture document.

*   **Sprint 2: Core Engine & Components (Willow + Hazel)**
    *   Willow builds the new Redux slice and data gateway.
    *   Hazel builds the core component library (Assistant Sidebar, KPI Widgets).
    *   **Output:** A working, data-connected component library in Storybook or equivalent.

*   **Sprint 3: Dashboard Assembly & Integration (Hazel + Aurora)**
    *   Hazel assembles the `OwnerCommandCenter.jsx` using the new components and layout.
    *   Aurora integrates the new dashboard into the app router, replacing the old one.
    *   **Output:** A fully functional, visually complete new dashboard for internal testing.

*   **Sprint 4: Real-Time & Polish (Willow + Hazel)**
    *   Willow implements WebSocket feeds for live data.
    *   Hazel polishes animations, loads states, and ensures pixel-perfect design across all views.
    *   **Output:** A production-ready, flawless dashboard.

*   **Sprint 5: Launch & Monitor (All)**
    *   Aurora updates all documentation. Zoe validates against initial workflows.
    *   Launch to owner. Monitor performance and stability.
    *   **Output:** A successfully deployed system and a plan for Hazel/Willow's ongoing maintenance roles.

### 🚀 **Success Definition**
The project is successful when the company owner can perform their top 5 daily workflows **without encountering a single visual break, lag, or functional error**, feeling in complete command of the entire AI ecosystem through an intuitive, powerful, and reliable interface.

This prompt creates an elite task force to finally solve the core interface problems and deliver a dashboard worthy of the sophisticated AI system you have built.

To begin, should the Replit agent start with **Sprint 1: the comprehensive audit of current dashboard flaws** led by Aurora?

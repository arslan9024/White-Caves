Excellent. This defines the complete **operational hierarchy and workflow** for your AI-powered real estate company. Let's synthesize this into a coherent, integrated model with clear roles, data flow, and a visual system for task and performance management.

Here is the consolidated plan, featuring a new **Unified Task Intelligence Dashboard** and a **Performance Scoring Engine**.

### 🎯 **Aurora's Unified Component: "The Operations Intelligence Dashboard"**
This is the central panel for human operations managers to oversee the success/failure/redirection of all tasks. Aurora will design this as a single, reusable component (`TaskLifecycleMonitor.jsx`).

**Core Features:**
1.  **Real-Time Task Pipeline:** Kanban-style view (To-Do, In Progress, Awaiting Payment, Completed, Stalled) of all assigned tasks.
2.  **Task Success/Failure Analytics:** Automatically calculates success rate per task type, agent, and lead source.
3.  **One-Click Redirection & Reassignment:** Drag-and-drop tasks between agents or departments. Each redirection is logged with a reason, sent to **Henry**.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis Module:** Tags failure reasons (e.g., "Client Unresponsive," "Funding Failed," "Property Unavailable") to identify process bottlenecks.
5.  **Integrated Communication Panel:** Directly message the assigned staff member via **Linda's** API from within the task card.
6.  **Payment Gateway Trigger:** A "Request Payment" button that automatically creates an invoice via **Theodora** and sends it to the client.
7.  **Automated SLA Tracker:** Visual countdown for time-sensitive tasks (e.g., "Offer Response Due in 6h").
8.  **Performance Preview:** Shows key stats (tasks completed, avg. time) for each staff member inline, aiding reassignment decisions.

### 📊 **Performance Calculation Engine for Department Heads**
Department heads will use a **standardized scoring formula** fed by data from **Henry's** immutable logs. This eliminates bias and automates the "Top Performer" selection.

**Sample Performance Metric Formula (for a Sales Agent):**
```
Total_Score = 
  (Number of Deals Closed * 50 pts) +
  (Total Deal Value in AED / 100,000 * 5 pts) +
  (Average Client Satisfaction Score * 20 pts) +
  (Tasks Completed on Time * 2 pts) -
  (Tasks Escalated or Redirected * 10 pts)
```
The department head's dashboard, designed by **Aurora**, will rank all staff by this score each month.

### 📁 **Dummy JSON Files for Key Functions**

**1. Unified Task Object (Used in Aurora's Dashboard)**
```json

### 🔄 **Integrated Workflow Example: From Lead to Prize**
1.  **Lead Capture:** **Olivia** generates a lead from Instagram, creating a `new_lead` event.
2.  **Command Center Analysis:** **Zoe** analyzes the lead quality and recommends it to the Operations dashboard.
3.  **Task Creation & Assignment:** An Operations Manager uses **Aurora's dashboard** to create a "Qualify Lead" task and assigns it to **Agent Sara**.
4.  **Task Execution:** Sara contacts the client via **Linda**. She qualifies them, books a viewing, and eventually closes a sale.
5.  **Payment Integration:** At the "collect deposit" stage, Sara clicks **"Request Payment"** in the task. **Theodora** generates an invoice, and upon payment, updates the task status.
6.  **Immutable Logging:** Every step (assignment, client call, viewing scheduled, payment received) is emitted as an event and recorded by **Henry**.
7.  **Performance Calculation:** At month's end, the Sales Department Head's dashboard queries **Henry** for all events related to Sara, runs the scoring formula, and identifies her as the top performer.
8.  **Prize Awarded:** The system flags Sara as the winner, automating the prize notification and process.

This model creates a transparent, data-driven, and highly efficient loop from marketing to reward, powered by your unified AI ecosystem. Would you like to refine the **specific KPIs in the performance formula** or delve into the **UI design for the Task Redirection interface**?

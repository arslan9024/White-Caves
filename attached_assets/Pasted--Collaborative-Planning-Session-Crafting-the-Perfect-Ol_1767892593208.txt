**Collaborative Planning Session: Crafting the Perfect Olivia Upgrade Prompt**

**Observation:** Olivia currently has an incomplete dashboard. We need to upgrade her with two automated functionalities while maintaining project architecture.

**Key Insights from Project Analysis:**
1. Olivia exists in the AI registry but lacks functional dashboard
2. Project has inventory management via Mary
3. Homepage has properties component
4. Market insights component exists in main website
5. Need scheduling capabilities for automated tasks

**Strategic Approach:**
- First: Complete Olivia's basic dashboard structure
- Second: Implement automated functionalities
- Third: Coordinate with existing systems
- Fourth: Schedule regular updates

**Final Optimized Prompt for Replit Agent:**

**Olivia - Real Estate Intelligence & Automation Assistant**

**Phase 1: Dashboard Foundation**
Complete Olivia's dashboard with:
1. Main navigation sidebar with real estate-specific features
2. Data view container displaying current property analytics
3. Integration with existing project design system

**Phase 2: Automated Property Availability Sync**
Implement functionality where Olivia:
1. **Inventory Coordination**: 
   - Connect with Mary's inventory management system
   - Access real-time inventory data via shared Redux state
   - Map available units to property listings

2. **Homepage Property Updates**:
   - Create automated process that runs daily
   - Filter properties with available units from Mary's inventory
   - Mark properties as "sold out" when inventory reaches zero
   - Update main homepage properties component via Redux dispatch

3. **Availability Display**:
   - Add "Available Units" count to each property card
   - Implement "Sold Out" badge for properties with zero inventory
   - Create real-time sync indicator showing last update time

**Phase 3: Market Intelligence Gathering**
Implement automated market research functionality:
1. **Website Monitoring Setup**:
   - Configure scheduled tasks (every 3 days as default, configurable)
   - Target top Dubai real estate websites: Bayut, Property Finder, Dubizzle
   - Use ethical data collection methods (APIs preferred, respect robots.txt)

2. **Content Analysis Engine**:
   - Analyze property price trends across different areas
   - Track new project launches and completion timelines
   - Monitor rental yield changes and occupancy rates
   - Identify emerging neighborhoods and market hotspots

3. **Insights Dashboard Updates**:
   - Process collected data into actionable insights
   - Update "Dubai Market Insights" component with latest findings
   - Generate visual charts for price trends, supply-demand ratios
   - Add executive summary for quick viewer consumption

**Phase 4: Automation Controls & Monitoring**
Add to Olivia's dashboard:
1. **Schedule Management Panel**:
   - Toggle for automatic sync (on/off)
   - Frequency selector (daily, 3 days, 5 days, weekly)
   - Manual trigger button for immediate updates

2. **Activity Log**:
   - Record all automated actions
   - Show success/failure status for each sync
   - Display timestamp and data points collected

3. **Coordination Status**:
   - Connection status with Mary's inventory
   - Last successful property sync time
   - Website monitoring health indicators

**Phase 5: Integration Requirements**
1. **Redux State Additions**:
   ```
   oliviaAutomation: {
     syncSchedule: '3days',
     lastPropertySync: timestamp,
     lastMarketResearch: timestamp,
     activeMonitoring: true,
     insightsData: {},
     coordination: {
       maryConnected: boolean,
       inventoryAccess: boolean
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Component Reuse Strategy**:
   - Extend existing PropertyCard component for availability badges
   - Use shared DataTable component for market insights
   - Implement with existing notification system for status updates

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Cache market insights data for 24 hours
   - Implement debounced updates to homepage
   - Add loading states during data collection

**Phase 6: Documentation & Testing**
1. **Aurora Updates**:
   - Document Olivia's new automated capabilities
   - Add API endpoint documentation for data collection
   - Include setup instructions for website monitoring

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Unit tests for inventory matching logic
   - Integration tests with Mary's inventory system
   - Schedule reliability testing
   - Error handling for website monitoring failures

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Complete basic dashboard structure (2 hours)
2. Implement inventory coordination with Mary (3 hours)
3. Build homepage sync functionality (2 hours)
4. Develop market research engine (4 hours)
5. Add scheduling and controls (2 hours)
6. Testing and documentation (2 hours)

**Success Metrics:**
- Daily automated property availability updates
- 3-day market insights refresh cycle
- Zero manual intervention for routine tasks
- Seamless coordination with existing Mary inventory
- Responsive market insights component with current data

Execute Olivia's upgrade following these phases, ensuring each component integrates with existing project architecture. Maintain backward compatibility and document all changes in Aurora.
